## psy-q.ch (and others) Ansible playbooks

Our Ansible playbooks. We mostly deal with Continuous Integration slaves and Ruby/jRuby, with or without Apache and Passenger. So that's also what our playbooks mostly contain.

They are for Debian GNU/Linux, and the policy is that these work for Debian GNU/Linux *only*.

Other Debianoid GNU/Linux distributions are explicitly not supported, and you should make your changes accordingly.
